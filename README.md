# FED Assignment 1

This is a website providing information regarding a fictional game. It will help new players by providing general information about the game (gameplay, plot, characters), as well as easily accesible download links. It will also appeal to existing players through a section including the latest news and updates on the game. It will also link to any other resources (social media platforms) regarding the game, serving as a covenient hub for all game-related information and sources.

## Design Process
 
- As a new player, I want to learn more general information about the game to see if it will interest me, and download the game on my preferred platform. This project contains easy and convenient access to a basic summary of all relevant information, such as a non-spoilered plot overview, introduction to gameplay, and brief character overviews. It also contains download links to the game on all available platforms.

- As an existing player, I want to always be on-top of the most updated information relating to the game. This project contains a dedicated news section for the game developers to reliably disseminate the most up-to-date and relevant news about the game, that I can look at. I can also follow the conveniently provided links to any additional, external sources of information.

- As a website user, I want to be able to very quickly and conveniently navigate around the website, and have it functioning on any device and browser I may use. I also want to be able to read the text with ease. This website has a navigation bar at the top that is always on screen and simple to use, and contains responsive HTML/CSS design. Text sizes are relatively large, and adhere to rules of colour contrast.

Wireframe for desktop and mobile layouts is included in the folder as "FED_10260078J_TanSiHueiChloe_Assg1_Wireframe.png"

## Features

### Existing Features
- Navigation bar turns into a hamburger menu in mobile layout, which can be opened and collapsed to show navigation sections.

### Features Left to Implement
- A filter button on the News page, that will categorise and filter articles by category (category examples: events, sales, in game updates, etc.)

## Technologies Used
- [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org)
    - HTML is used to create the website frame.
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css)
    - CSS is used to visually style the website.
- [Javascript](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)
    - Javascript is used to add basic functionalities to the website (see Features)
- [Clip Studio Paint](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsq_ej8jZggMVP6lmAh2fiAgbEAAYASAAEgK6PvD_BwE)
    - Art program used to create/edit the website images.

## Testing
Project has accounted for all width changes, and will change to mobile layout (as drawn in wireframe) at appropriate widths. However, at very short heights, project elements will begin to overlap, and may be cut off.

Project is designed to look and function the same on most browsers. There may be visual differences depending on whether browser supports webkit functionality. 
Confirmed to be fully functional on modern Chromium and Microsoft Edge browsers.
A notable bug appears on Firefox, where character page will display incorrectly (character info displayed too far too the left), and will not display on shorter widths entirely.
