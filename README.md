# Your Project's Name

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing
Project has accounted for all width changes, and will change to mobile layout (as drawn in wireframe) at appropriate widths. However, at very short heights, project elements will begin to overlap, and may be cut off.

Project is designed to look and function the same on most browsers. There may be visual differences depending on whether browser supports webkit functionality. 
Confirmed to be fully functional on modern Chromium and Microsoft Edge browsers.
A notable bug appears on Firefox, where character page will display incorrectly (character info displayed too far too the left), and will not display on shorter widths entirely.
